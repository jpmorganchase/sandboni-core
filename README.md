## This project is archived as of 14-Dec-2022

Sandboni is a `Java test optimization library` which reduces test execution time without 
compromising quality, predicts defect probability and presents actionable test results 
which allows developers to take preemptive measures.

Instead of applying a brute force approach to testing (i.e. executing all tests each time 
there is a code change), Sandboni determines the code slice affected by the change and 
executes only those tests related to the change. This test filtering is based on the static 
code analysis that lets us determine required tests without paying the price for executing them

## Features
* Compute a change scope (CS) between two revisions
* Build a change dependency graph (CDG) for a specific change scope
* Find and execute related/disconnected tests based on the CDG
* Support JVM and Cucumber tests

## Structure of code

The code is in a [multi-module](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-modules.html) project structure

* scm - builds a change scope between two revisions 
    * [jGit](https://github.com/eclipse/jgit)
* engine - analyzes bytecode by locations, builds CDG and it contains the main algorithms for the graph traversing
    * [Bcel](https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel)
    * [JGraphT](https://github.com/jgrapht/jgrapht)
